"""Given an array and a range a, b. The task is to partition the array around the range such that the array is divided into three parts.
1) All elements smaller than a come first.
2) All elements in range a to b come next.
3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to return the modified array.

Note: The generated output is true if you modify the given array successfully. Otherwise false.

Geeky Challenge: Solve this problem in O(n) time complexity.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4], a = 1, b = 2
Output: true
Explanation: One possible arrangement is: {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}. If you return a valid arrangement, output will be true.

Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1], a = 1, b = 3
Output: true
Explanation: One possible arrangement is: {1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 6}. If you return a valid arrangement, output will be true.
