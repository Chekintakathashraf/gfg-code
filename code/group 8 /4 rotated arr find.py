"""Given a rotated sorted array nums (sorted in ascending order, then rotated at some pivot), find the minimum element in the array. 
What is a Rotated Sorted Array? 

Imagine you have a sorted array in ascending order: 

 

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] 

 

If you "rotate" this array at some point, it means you take some elements from the front and move them to the back â€” or equivalently, cut the array at a pivot and swap the two parts. 

For example, if you rotate it at index 3, you take the first 3 elements [1, 2, 3] and move them after the rest: 

 

Original: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] 

Rotated:  [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3] 

 

Notice: 

    The order within the two parts remains sorted. 

    The array is not fully sorted anymore because of the rotation. 

    The smallest element is now somewhere in the middle (at index 4 here). """
